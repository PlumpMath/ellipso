## Introduction
Last christmas my girlfriend bought me a [Sphero](http://gosphero.com/) which I spent a few weeks
messing about with, and then put it in a drawer.  I've pulled it back out and built this library to
play with some Clojure code.  This library provides basic integration with the Sphero device,
implementing the protocol documented as [Orbotix Communication API](https://github.com/orbotix/DeveloperResources/blob/master/docs/Sphero_API_1.46.pdf?raw=true).

## Usage
All of this is subject to change but:

    (require '[ellipso.core :as core])
    (def sphero (core/connect "/dev/tty.Sphero-RBR-RN-SPP"))

You'll need to change the connect string to the one for your Sphero.

    (require '[ellipso.commands :as commands])
    (def rainbow
      (map commands/colour [0xFF0000 0xFF8000 0xFFFF00 0x00FF00 0x0000FF 0x8000FF 0xFF00FF]))
    (def spin
      (let [speeds (range 0x30 0xFF 0x30)
            cycle  (concat speeds (reverse speeds))]
        (map (partial commands/spin commands/CLOCKWISE) cycle))))

    (reduce commands/execute
            sphero
            (flatten (interpose (commands/pause 1000) (map list rainbow spin))))

Best to review the code in the `ellipso.commands` namespace.  Basically commands
are functions that are applied to a `ellipso.core/Sphero` instance.

You can also receive, asynchronously, sensor data from the Sphero:

    (require '[ellipso.sensor-data :as sensors] :reload)
    ((sensors/data-streaming sensors/everything 100 println) sphero)

This causes the Sphero to send 100 packets of information about the onboard
sensors, which are then printed to the screen.  If the number was zero then
it would stream indefinitely.

## TODO
* implement more of the commands, especially the collision detection support;
* look more into the state monad because that's what is needed;
* work out how to do [The Batman Curve](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BatmanCurve.html)!

## Version History
0.1.1-SNAPSHOT
* Added sensor data support;
* Fixed a small typo in the example code!

0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
* Initial version with several of the commands implemented.
